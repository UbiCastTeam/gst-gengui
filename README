gst-gengui README
=====================

gst-gengui is an utility for testing and controlling live GStreamer pipelines and elements.
It will inspect the specified pipeline to create the GTK GUI "automagically", based on the value type of properties.

gst-gengui currently requires (Ubuntu 8.04/8.10 package names):
   * python-gtk2
   * python-gst0.10
   * python-gobject
   * xdot python interactive dot viewer (sudo easy_install xdot)

Non-packaged dependancies:
   * https://launchpad.net/easyevent
   * http://code.google.com/p/gstmanager/

It has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10 and 10.04

FEATURES
========

   * gst-launch-type syntax
   * pipeline controls: play, pause, stop, send_eos
   * pipeline states display: current state, current position, duration (if available)
   * pipeline editing and relaunching
   * automatic video texture embedding
   * properties control using gtk widgets for all (common) data types
   * pipeline graph (.dot format) displaying

USAGE
=====

Will launch the gst-launch-compliant pipeline description:
gst-gengui videotestsrc ! xvimagesink sync=false

If no argument is given, it will launch the pipeline description found in the gstgengui/config.py file

INSTALLATION
============

Note: using the following as command from this directory instead of gst-gengui will let you use gst-gengui without doing the symlinks
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python gstgengui/gst-gengui.py

Install symlinks: execute setup.sh

OPTIONS
=======

Check the gstgengui/config.py file for options and examples.

The config file contains static declarations for:
* ignore-list: properties having one of these names will not be "introspected"
* pipeline_desc: gstreamer pipeline description, in gst-launch-like syntax. caps need to be set the following way (without the quotes):

pipeline_desc = "videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv, format=(fourcc)YUY2, width=(int)320, height=(int)240, framerate=(fraction)15/1 ! ffmpegcolorspace !  videobalance ! queue ! xvimagesink"
